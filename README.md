## Safety Notice
In order to use this product safely and fully understand all its functions, read this manual before using the product. Follow the instructions for use for the used PC and the connected devices for allowed environmental conditions. The used PC must not go to sleep, hibernate, turn off, or turn on the screensaver during a measurement.

**Warning:**<br>
Conductible parts of all Unicorn BCI Core-8 Electrodes must not have contact with the earth or other conductible parts.

**Warning:**<br>
Avoid electrostatic discharge impulses when handling the device or touching the Unicorn BCI Core-8 Electrodes.

**Warning:**<br>
Electrostatic discharge (ESD) events can harm electronic components inside your Unicorn BCI Core-8. Under certain conditions, electric charge may build up on your body or an object, such as a peripheral, and then discharge into another object, such as your Unicorn BCI Core-8. To prevent ESD damage, you should discharge static electricity from your body before you interact with any of your devices. You can protect against ESD and discharge static electricity from your body by touching a metal grounded object.

**Warning:**<br>
Pay attention to the precautions regarding electromagnetic compatibility.

**Warning:**<br>
The operation of the device can be compromised within shielded rooms. In case of problems, relocate the receiving device or consult technical support.

**Warning:**<br>
The operator must be familiar with the operation of the device and must operate the device according to the instructions for use.

**Warning:**<br>
The device and its accessories must not be exposed to increased mechanical stress.

**Warning:**<br>
Each time you use the device, you must first check the device and its accessories for possible damage to connectors, sockets and cables. Check the Unicorn BCI Core-8 electrode cable connections with special care and ensure that the electrode cables have no breaks or cracks. Any cables, connectors, accessories, or other parts of the equipment must be replaced immediately if damaged or not working correctly.

**Warning:**<br>
The Unicorn BCI Core-8 is not protected against electrical defibrillation - before defibrillation, the Unicorn BCI Core-8 Electrodes must be removed from the subject!

**Warning:**<br>

### Assembling / Disassembling

The following section describes how to assemble or disassemble the Unicorn.

#### Insert / Remove Unicorn BCI Core-8 Electrodes

The Unicorn BCI Core-8 Band features nine holes for holding nine Unicorn BCI Core-8 EEG Electrodes. The first groove of the electrode is used to attach the electrode connector clip. The second groove is provided to insert and hold the electrode within a Unicorn cap. Stretch one of the predefined electrode holes of the Unicorn BCI Core-8 Band and insert the electrode until the second groove of the electrode is surrounded by fabric. Insert all nine Unicorn BCI Core-8 Electrodes into the predefined positions of the Unicorn cap.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/unicorn_headband_7.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/><br/>
</p>

#### Connect / Disconnect Unicorn BCI Core-8 Electrodes

To connect or disconnect the clip connector to/from the Unicorn BCI Core-8 Electrode, just slide the clip connector on or off. Make sure that the clip surrounds the first groove of the electrode and that the holes of the electrode and electrode clip overlap.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/unicorn_headband_8.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/><br/>
</p>

### Turn the device on and off

You have to dock the Unicorn BCI Core-8 Amplifier on the Unicorn BCI Core-8 Basestation to turn the device on. The magnetic connector should hold the device on the Unicorn BCI Core-8 Basestation. The satus LED should turn on and show the current device state.

You have to remove the Unicorn BCI Core-8 Amplifier from the Unicorn BCI Core-8 Basestation to turn the device off.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/unicorn_headband_5.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/><br/>
</p>

**Note:**<br>
Charge the the device if the status LED doesn't start fading when placed on the Unicorn BCI Core-8 Basestation.

### Transportation

Remove the Unicorn BCI Core-8 Amplifier from the Unicorn BCI Core-8 Basestation to turn the device off. Put the device onto the Unicorn BCI Core-8 Basestation so you can see the USB connector and the gold pins. The magnetic connector should hold the device on the Unicorn BCI Core-8 Basestation.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/unicorn_headband_13.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/><br/>
</p>

### Charging the device

Lift the Unicorn BCI Core-8 Amplifier from the Unicorn BCI Core-8 Basestation in order to be able to access the USB connector. Insert the Unicorn USB Charging Cable to charge the device. The status LED will be turned on continously until the device is fully charged. The Status LED will be turned off if the device is fully charged.

**Note:**<br>
The Unicorn BCI Core-8 has a built-in Lithium-Polymer accumulator. The accumulator may be partly discharged when the system is delivered.

**Note:**<br>
As long as the USB port of the Unicorn Brain Interface is connected to a working USB port of a PC, Notebook or appropriate wall adapter, the Unicorn Brain Interface can’t be turned on.

**Note:**<br>
Charging an empty Unicorn battery will take about 3 hours.

**Warning:**<br>
Do not over-discharge the Unicorn BCI Core-8 battery. Over-discharging can damage the Unicorn BCI Core-8 battery or reduce the performance and life-time.

**Warning:**<br>
The Unicorn BCI Core-8 cell/battery would be at an over-discharged state by its self-discharge characteristics if the cell is not used for long time. Over long storage periods, batteries should be cycled every 90 days.

**Warning:**<br>
Store in a 50 % charged state. Do not store at fully charged state (4.2V) for a long period of time.

**Warning:**<br>

The Unicorn BCI Core-8 complies with Part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions: (1) this Unicorn BCI Core-8 may not cause harmful interference, and (2) this Unicorn BCI Core-8 must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.

### FCC RF Radiation Exposure statement
This Unicorn BCI Core-8 complies with Industry Canada license-exempt RSS standard(s). Operation is subject to the following two conditions: (1) this Unicorn BCI Core-8 may not cause interference, and (2) this Unicorn BCI Core-8 must accept any interference, including interference that may cause undesired operation of the Unicorn BCI Core-8.

Under Industry Canada regulations, this radio transmitter may only operate using an antenna of a type and maximum (or lesser) gain approved for the transmitter by Industry Canada. To reduce potential radio interference to other users, the antenna type and its gain should be chosen so that the equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) is not more than that necessary for successful communication.

**Note:**<br>
The Unicorn BCI Core-8 uses the 2.4 GHz band for wireless transmission. Ensure that enough transmission bandwidth is available in your environment, since other devices might also use the same band (e.g. WiFi or other Bluetooth devices). Use wireless screening tools to ensure the availability of the necessary transmission channel.

## Transportation and storage conditions
The Unicorn Brain Interface can be stored at temperatures between –20° to +45° Celsius. The relative humidity must be between 25 % and 80 %. If there is any condensed water, wait until it disappears before use (wait at least 1 h in a heated room).

## Location details
Do not use the Unicorn Brain Interface near a heating system or directly in the sun. During operation, the outside temperature should be between +5° Celsius and +35° Celsius and the air pressure between 700 and 1060 hPa.

## Waste disposal details
Bring the Unicorn Brain Interface to a recycling center or sent it back to the manufacturer.
